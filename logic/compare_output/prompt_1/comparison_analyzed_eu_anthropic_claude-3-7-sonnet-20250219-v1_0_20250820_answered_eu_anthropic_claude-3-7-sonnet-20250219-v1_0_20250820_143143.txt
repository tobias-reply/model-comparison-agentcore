ORIGINAL QUESTION:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In one state, 52% of the voters are Republicans, and 48% are Democrats. In a second state, 47% of the voters are Republicans, and 53% are Democrats. Suppose a simple random sample of 100 voters are surveyed from each state.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
CORRECT ANSWER:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The correct answer is C. For this analysis, let P1 = the proportion of Republican voters in the first state, P2 = the proportion of Republican voters in the second state, p1 = the proportion of Republican voters in the sample from the first state, and p2 = the proportion of Republican voters in the sample from the second state. The number of voters sampled from the first state (n1) = 100, and the number of voters sampled from the second state (n2) = 100.
