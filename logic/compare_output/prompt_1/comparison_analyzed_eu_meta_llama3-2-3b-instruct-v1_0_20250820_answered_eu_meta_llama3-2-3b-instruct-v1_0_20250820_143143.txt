ORIGINAL QUESTION:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In one state, 52% of the voters are Republicans, and 48% are Democrats. In a second state, 47% of the voters are Republicans, and 53% are Democrats. Suppose a simple random sample of 100 voters are surveyed from each state.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
CORRECT ANSWER:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The correct answer is C. For this analysis, let P1 = the proportion of Republican voters in the first state, P2 = the proportion of Republican voters in the second state, p1 = the proportion of Republican voters in the sample from the first state, and p2 = the proportion of Republican voters in the sample from the second state. The number of voters sampled from the first state (n1) = 100, and the number of voters sampled from the second state (n2) = 100.

"Step 5: Find P(Z > 0.708)\nUsing the standard normal table, P(Z < 0.708) ≈ 0.76\n\nTherefore, P(Z > 0.708) = 1 - P(Z < 0.708) = 1 - 0.76 = 0.24\n\nThe probability is 0.24, which corresponds to answer choice (C).\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 0.24."

User requested answer for following problem: In one state, 52% of the voters are Republicans, and 48% are Democrats. In a second state, 47% of the voters are Republicans, and 53% are Democrats. Suppose a simple random sample of 100 voters are surveyed from each state.. AI-Agent responded like this: "Step 5: Find P(Z > 0.708)\nUsing the standard normal table, P(Z < 0.708) ≈ 0.76\n\nTherefore, P(Z > 0.708) = 1 - P(Z < 0.708) = 1 - 0.76 = 0.24\n\nThe probability is 0.24, which corresponds to answer choice (C).\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 0.24.". This is the answer we know is correct: The correct answer is C. For this analysis, let P1 = the proportion of Republican voters in the first state, P2 = the proportion of Republican voters in the second state, p1 = the proportion of Republican voters in the sample from the first state, and p2 = the proportion of Republican voters in the sample from the second state. The number of voters sampled from the first state (n1) = 100, and the number of voters sampled from the second state (n2) = 100..
