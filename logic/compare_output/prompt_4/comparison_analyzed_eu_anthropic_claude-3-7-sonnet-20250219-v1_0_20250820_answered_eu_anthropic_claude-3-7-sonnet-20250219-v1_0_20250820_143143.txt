ORIGINAL QUESTION:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
How many different ways can you arrange the letters X, Y, and Z?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
CORRECT ANSWER:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
One way to solve this problem is to list all of the possible permutations of X, Y, and Z. They are: XYZ, XZY, YXZ, YZX, ZXY, and ZYX. Thus, there are 6 possible permutations.

"I'll solve this permutation problem step by step.\n\nStep 1: Identify what we're looking for\n- We need to find the number of ways to arrange 3 distinct letters (X, Y, and Z)\n- This is a permutation problem where order matters\n\nStep 2: Apply the permutation formula\nFor n distinct objects, the number of possible arrangements is n!\n\nIn this case, n = 3, so the number of arrangements is 3!\n\nStep 3: Calculate 3!\n3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6\n\nTherefore, there are 6 different ways to arrange the letters X, Y, and Z.\n\nThe possible arrangements are:\n1. XYZ\n2. XZY\n3. YXZ\n4. YZX\n5. ZXY\n6. ZYX"
