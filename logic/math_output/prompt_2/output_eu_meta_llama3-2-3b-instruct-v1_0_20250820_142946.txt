Prompt: A card is drawn randomly from a deck of ordinary playing cards. You win $10 if the card is a spade or an ace. What is the probability that you will win the game?
Correct Answer: Let S = the event that the card is a spade; and let A = the event that the card is an ace. You will win the game if either of these two events occur. Therefore, this problem requires you to find the probability of the union of two events.

We know the following:

There are 52 cards in the deck.
There are 13 spades, so P(S) = 13/52.
There are 4 aces, so P(A) = 4/52.
There is 1 ace that is also a spade, so P(S ∩ A) = 1/52.
Therefore, based on the rule of addition:

P(S ∪ A) = P(S) + P(A) - P(S ∩ A)
P(S ∪ A) = 13/52 + 4/52 - 1/52 = 16/52 = 4/13
--------------------------------------------------
Response: "Probability = 16/52 = 4/13 ≈ 0.308\n\nTherefore, the probability of winning the game is 4/13 or approximately 0.308 (30.8%)."
