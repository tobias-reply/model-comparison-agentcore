Prompt: How many different ways can you arrange the letters X, Y, and Z?
Correct Answer: One way to solve this problem is to list all of the possible permutations of X, Y, and Z. They are: XYZ, XZY, YXZ, YZX, ZXY, and ZYX. Thus, there are 6 possible permutations.

Another approach is to use the formula for counting permutations. That formula appears below.

How to count permutations. The number of permutations of nobjects taken r at a time is:
nPr = n(n - 1)(n - 2) ... (n - r + 1) = n! / (n - r)!
The above formula tells us that the number of permutations is n! / (n - r)!. We have 3 distinct objects (the letters X, Y, and Z) so n = 3. And we want to arrange them in groups of 3, so r = 3. Thus, the number of permutations is 3! / (3 - 3)! or 3! / 0!. This is equal to (3)(2)(1)/1 = 6.

Response: "I'll solve this permutation problem step by step.\n\nStep 1: Identify what we're looking for\n- We need to find the number of ways to arrange 3 distinct letters (X, Y, and Z)\n- This is a permutation problem where order matters\n\nStep 2: Apply the permutation formula\nFor n distinct objects, the number of possible arrangements is n!\n\nIn this case, n = 3, so the number of arrangements is 3!\n\nStep 3: Calculate 3!\n3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6\n\nTherefore, there are 6 different ways to arrange the letters X, Y, and Z.\n\nThe possible arrangements are:\n1. XYZ\n2. XZY\n3. YXZ\n4. YZX\n5. ZXY\n6. ZYX"
